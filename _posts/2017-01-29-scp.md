SCP, use it to push/pull files to/from *nix systems. The following is a list of commands that I find myself coming back to over and over again.

Single local file to remote host:

        scp -i ~/.ssh/<mycert>.pem ~/Documents/awesome_file.txt user@<ip>:/tmp/

Multiple local files to remote host:

        scp -i ~/.ssh/<mycert>.pem ~/Documents/awesome_file_* user@<ip>:/tmp/

Recursive local files to remote host:

        scp -i ~/.ssh/<mycert>.pem -r ~/Documents/awesome_files/* user@<ip>:/tmp/

Remote file(s) to localhost:

        scp -i ~/.ssh/<mycert>.pem user@<ip>:/path/to/awesome/super_file.txt ~/Downloads/
