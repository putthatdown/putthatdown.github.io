The following is a list of SCP commands that I find myself coming back to over and over again:

* Single local file to remote host - `scp -i ~/.ssh/<mycert>.pem ~/Documents/awesome_file.txt user@<ip>:/tmp/`
* Multiple local files to remote host - `scp -i ~/.ssh/<mycert>.pem ~/Documents/awesome_file_* user@<ip>:/tmp/`
* Recursive local files to remote host - `scp -i ~/.ssh/<mycert>.pem -r ~/Documents/awesome_files/* user@<ip>:/tmp/`
* Remote file(s) to localhost - `scp -i ~/.ssh/<mycert>.pem user@<ip>:/home/user/path/to/awesome/super_file.txt ~/Downloads/`
