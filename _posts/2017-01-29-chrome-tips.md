Generally, I use the Chrome browser for day-to-day things. I don't often have issues or have a need for the more advanced features, like developer tools, but it does happen. Some of the my more commonly used features are detailed below:

## Chrome hard reset:

1. `command + alt + I`
2. Right click and hold refresh button > Empty Cache and Hard Reload

**OR**

2. `command + shift + R`
