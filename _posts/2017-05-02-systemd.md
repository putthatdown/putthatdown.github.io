SURPRISE! Ubuntu 16 defaults to using SystemD to start all services instead of Upstart.

SystemD unit files:

        - /lib/systemd/system/ (lowest priority)
        - /run/systemd/system/
        - /etc/systemd/system/ (highest priority)

View contents of a unit file:

        systemctl cat <service_name>.service

Basic service management:

        sudo systemctl start <service_name>.service
        sudo systemctl stop <service_name>.service
        sudo systemctl restart <service_name>.service
        sudo systemctl reload <service_name>.service

Enable/disable start on boot:

        sudo systemctl enable <service_name>.service
        sudo systemctl disable <service_name>.service

SystemD also does logging a little differently. Instead of dropping a log in `/var/log`, units (services) generally write to JournalD and can be viewed in one of 2 ways:

        systemctl status <service_name>.service
        journalctl -u <service_name>.service
