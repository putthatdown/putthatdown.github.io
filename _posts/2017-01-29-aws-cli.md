Having multiple AWS accounts, I needed a way to have several AWS profiles available at any given time. With the following configuration, I've been able to keep things straight with minimum effort on my Mac:

1. Get `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key` from the AWS console
2. Create/edit - `~\.aws\configuration`
3. Add a new profile with the `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`:

        [default]
        aws_access_key_id = ABCDEFG
        aws_secret_access_key = 1234567890

        [user1]
        aws_access_key_id = 1234567890
        aws_secret_access_key = ABCDEFG

4. Edit `~/.bash_profile`
5. Add/edit the `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` environment variable, add the profile you want to use:

        export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=user1

6. Re-source any open terminals - `source ~/.bash_profile`
7. (OPTIONAL) Create and keep a separate `~/.aws/config` with a mapping for each profile:

        [default]
        output = json
        region = us-east-1

        [profile user1]
        output = json
        region = us-east-1

Use a specific profile on the fly:

        aws <api> <command> --profile <profile_from_configuration> --region <region>

        aws ec2 describe-instances --profile personal --region us-east-1
