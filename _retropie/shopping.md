Creating a dedicated emulation rig is cheap, fun, and only takes up the tiniest bit of space. Let's go shopping!

## The essentials

* [Official Raspberry Pi 3 case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01F1PSFY6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (~$8)
* [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 with 2.5A Micro USB Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C6FFNY4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (~$45)
* [Samsung EVO 64GB Micro SDXC Memory Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IVPU7AO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (~$30)
* [2 Packs Classic Nintendo USB NES Controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EUZEQLO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (~$12)

The controllers are essentially the best of the worst. Ratings for USB classic Nintendo controllers are pretty universally <3.5 stars out of 5. Out of the 2 pack on my list, one was damn near unusable and the other only got a little squirrelly using the D-Pad down button. I ended up submitting for a refund from the company, which they granted without asking for the controllers back. So even thought they aren't great, they were FREE, wo0t!

## The bells and whistles

* [Remote Control Converter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Woods-32555WD-Weatherproof-Outdoor-Converter/dp/B001Q9EFUK/ref=sr_1_4?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1495212487&sr=1-4&keywords=remote+control+ac+switch)
* [Buffalo iBuffalo Classic USB Gamepad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B9XB0E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (~$25)

Although the CanaKit Raspberry Pi comes with a power supply, there is no ON/OFF/RESTART for the Pi, so the only thing you can do is pull the plug. I could've just used a switched outlet or a powerstrip, but remote controller kit was a nice convenience add.

The iBuffalo USB gamepad is pretty universally acclaimed as the best 'retro' USB controller. It doesn't have the same feel as the old NES controller, but it works, so there's that.
