Hardware received, software ready, lets put it together.

1. Take the case apart
2. Take the board out of the box
3. Attach the heat syncs to the chips on the board
4. Install the memory card
5. Put the board in the case. There's really only one way, you can't get it wrong. Just don't force anything and you'll be fine.
6. Re-assemble the case
7. Hook up the controller(s), HDMI, Ethernet, and keyboard
8. Connect the power cable

Since there's no on/off switch, everything needs to be connected before plugging the machine in. There's also no way for it to detect new or changed hardware on-the-fly, so if you un/attach anything, you'll have to restart before the changes are discovered.
